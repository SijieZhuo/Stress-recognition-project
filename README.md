# Phishing Avoidance Project üè∞
An Android application and a Stress recognition API combination to practice the research about phishing avoidance with general devices.  (by processing the PPG data sent from the client-side)

## Terminologies
Phishing: Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details or other sensitive details, by impersonating oneself as a trustworthy entity in a digital communication. (From [Wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing#:~:text=Phishing%20is%20the%20fraudulent%20attempt,entity%20in%20a%20digital%20communication.))
PPG: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple optical technique used to detect volumetric changes in blood in the peripheral circulation. It is a low-cost and non-invasive method that makes measurements at the surface of the skin. The technique provides valuable information related to our cardiovascular system. (From [News Medical!](https://www.news-medical.net/health/Photoplethysmography-(PPG).aspx#:~:text=Photoplethysmography%20(PPG)%20is%20a%20simple,related%20to%20our%20cardiovascular%20system.))
HRV: Heart rate variability is literally the variance in time between the beats of your heart. (From [Whoop!](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/heart-rate-variability-hrv/#:~:text=Heart%20rate%20variability%20is%20literally,1.15%20seconds%20between%20two%20others.))
